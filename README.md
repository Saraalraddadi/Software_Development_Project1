**(Object-Oriented Programming and Unit Testing)**


## Scenario

Your friend Sarah is a really big fan of association football (also known as soccer). She regularly reads the results of major competitions online. She also plays for her local soccer club. They play each Saturday night, and each Sunday, Sarah updates her competition’s league tables in order to track her team’s performance against other teams. This is a very time consuming manual process. Sarah would like a way to automatically update her competition’s league tables after each game is played. Sarah would like her solution to be flexible, so that it could be applied to other sports in the future. Luckily, Sarah completed CAB302 in 2016 and so knows that writing a Java program will help her solve her problem. Sarah has begun writing her program and wants you to help finish the coding and to test it.


## Getting Started

* **src**: This directory contains all the source code.
* **doc**: This directory contains the API. It has been generated using the Javadoc tool on a complete system.
* **libs**: This directory contains the libraries for JUnit and Hamcrest.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install:

```
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Eclipse editor
```

## Running the tests

The test classes will be executed on a series of defective solutions to ensure that they adequately detect programming errors. The unit tests are deemed to have detected a programming error in a defective program if more of the tests fail when applied to the defective program than when the tests are applied to our ‘ideal’ solution.

To assess the unit tests defective solutions will be executed against the following classes:

* asgn1Tests.SportsTeamFormTests (asgn1Tests.SportsTeamForm)
* asgn1Tests.SoccerTeamTests (asgn1Tests.SoccerTeam)
* asgn1Tests.SoccerLeagueTests (asgn1Tests.SoccerLeague)
* asgn1Tests.SoccerCompetitionTests (asgn1Tests.SoccerCompetition)


## Built With
